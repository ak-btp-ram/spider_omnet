This Python code is designed to perform the following operations in sequence:

### **Purpose:**
The script collects and analyzes ping times (Round Trip Times, RTT) to a set of nodes defined in a JSON file. It also provides options for re-pinging the nodes or processing previously recorded ping data. The results are visualized as a cumulative histogram.

---

### **Breakdown of Functions:**

#### 1. **`parse_json_data()`**
- **Purpose:** Reads a JSON file to extract a list of IP addresses for nodes to ping.
- **Steps:**
  - Opens a JSON file (`lnd_july15_2019.json`) located at the path defined by `LND_FILE_PATH` in the `config` module.
  - Extracts the `"nodes"` key from the JSON, iterating over each node's `"addresses"`.
  - Filters out addresses containing `"onion"` (used for Tor network) and appends the rest to `ping_addresses`.

#### 2. **`ping_node(ip_addr)`**
- **Purpose:** Pings a specific IP address and returns the ping statistics as a dictionary.
- **Steps:**
  - Uses `pingparsing.PingTransmitter` to send 10 ICMP ping packets to the destination `ip_addr`.
  - Parses the result with `pingparsing.PingParsing`.
  - Handles errors by returning `None` and printing the raw result if parsing fails.

#### 3. **`ping_nodes(addr_list)`**
- **Purpose:** Pings all nodes in the provided list of addresses, aggregates RTT data, and calculates basic statistics.
- **Steps:**
  - Iterates over `addr_list`, extracts the IP portion from addresses (`split(":")[0]`).
  - Calls `ping_node` for each address.
  - Writes RTT averages to a file (`ping_times_data`) and prints addresses with RTT < 10 ms.
  - Computes and prints the **mean**, **median**, and **variance** of the RTTs collected.

#### 4. **`parse_rtts_from_file()`**
- **Purpose:** Reads RTT values from the previously saved file (`ping_times_data`).
- **Steps:**
  - Opens the file and reads line by line.
  - Filters out invalid lines (containing `"None"` or spaces) and converts valid lines to `float`.
  - Returns the list of RTTs.

#### 5. **`visualize_rtts(rtts)`**
- **Purpose:** Visualizes the RTT data using a cumulative histogram.
- **Steps:**
  - Plots a histogram of RTTs with 100 bins, normalized and cumulative.
  - Saves the plot to a PDF file (`lnd_ping_rtt_spread.pdf`).
  - Prints basic statistics: **mean**, **median**, **variance**, **max**, and **min** of RTTs.

### **Execution Flow:**

1. **Command-Line Argument Parsing:**
   - The script uses the `--rerun-ping` flag to determine whether to rerun ping operations or use existing data.
   - `args.rerun_ping` is set to `True` if the flag is provided.

2. **Address List Parsing:**
   - Calls `parse_json_data` to get the list of IP addresses to ping.

3. **Ping Operations or File Parsing:**
   - If `--rerun-ping` is provided:
     - Calls `ping_nodes` to ping all nodes and collect RTT data.
   - Otherwise:
     - Calls `parse_rtts_from_file` to load RTTs from the saved file.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Calls `visualize_rtts` to generate and save the RTT histogram and print statistics.

### **Key Outputs:**
1. **File Outputs:**
   - `ping_times_data`: Contains RTT averages for all pinged nodes.
   - `lnd_ping_rtt_spread.pdf`: A cumulative histogram of RTTs.

2. **Statistics:**
   - **Mean RTT:** Average of all RTTs.
   - **Median RTT:** Middle RTT value.
   - **Variance:** Spread of RTT values.
   - **Max/Min RTT:** Highest and lowest RTT values.

3. **Console Logs:**
   - Number of addresses processed.
   - Nodes with RTT < 10 ms.
   - Summary statistics for RTTs.
