The provided script appears to be part of a larger project involving simulation, data analysis, and plotting for a Payment Channel Network (PCN) or a similar distributed system. Below is a detailed explanation of each section and its purpose:

---

### **1. Constants and Path Definitions**

```python
HOME = os.getenv('HOME')
OMNET = os.getenv('OMNET')
KAGGLE_PATH = HOME + '/' + OMNET + '/samples/spider_omnet/scripts/data/'
KAGGLE_AMT_DIST_FILENAME = KAGGLE_PATH + 'amt_dist.npy'
KAGGLE_AMT_MODIFIED_DIST_FILENAME = KAGGLE_PATH + 'amt_dist_cutoff.npy'
KAGGLE_TIME_DIST_FILENAME = KAGGLE_PATH + 'time_dist.npy'
```

- **Environment Variables:** `HOME` and `OMNET` are fetched from the system's environment. They determine the base directories for the file paths.
- **Data Paths:** The script defines paths to files (`amt_dist.npy`, `amt_dist_cutoff.npy`, etc.) for use in a Kaggle project. These files might store data distributions in NumPy format related to transaction amounts and times.

```python
PATH_PKL_DATA = "path_data/"
SAT_TO_EUR = 9158
```

- **`PATH_PKL_DATA`:** Likely a directory for storing pickled data files.
- **`SAT_TO_EUR`:** A conversion factor from Satoshis (Bitcoin's smallest unit) to Euros.

### **2. Simulation Constants**

```python
SEED = 23
SEED_LIST = [23, 4773, 76189, 99889, 1968, 2329]
```

- **Seeds:** These seeds ensure reproducibility in experiments or random operations. `SEED_LIST` provides multiple options for running simulations under different conditions.

```python
SCALE_AMOUNT = 30
MEAN_RATE = 10
CIRCULATION_STD_DEV = 2
LARGE_BALANCE = 1000000000
REASONABLE_BALANCE = 15000 
REASONABLE_ROUTER_BALANCE = 1000
MIN_TXN_SIZE = 0.1
MAX_TXN_SIZE = 10
```

- **Scale Factors and Limits:**
  - `SCALE_AMOUNT`: Scaling factor for amounts.
  - `MEAN_RATE`: Average rate of transactions.
  - `CIRCULATION_STD_DEV`: Standard deviation for balance circulation.
  - `LARGE_BALANCE`, `REASONABLE_BALANCE`, etc., define balance thresholds for nodes or routers.
  - `MIN_TXN_SIZE` and `MAX_TXN_SIZE`: Define transaction size limits.

```python
SMALLEST_UNIT=1
MEASUREMENT_INTERVAL = 200
```

- **Measurement Intervals:** Defines intervals for performance measurements.

---

### **3. Network Configurations**

```python
EC2_INSTANCE_ADDRESS="ec2-34-224-216-215.compute-1.amazonaws.com"
PORT_NUMBER=8000
```

- **EC2 Details:** Points to a remote server address and port for communication.

---

### **4. Parameters for Lightning Network Daemon (LND)**

```python
ENDHOST_LND_ONE_WAY_CAPACITY = 1000000000
ROUTER_CAPACITY = 100
LND_FILE_PATH = HOME + "/" + OMNET + "/samples/spider_omnet/lnd_data/"
LOG_NORMAL_MEAN=-0.6152
LOG_NORMAL_SCALE=0.7310
```

- **LND Setup:** These parameters are for simulating nodes in a Lightning Network:
  - `ENDHOST_LND_ONE_WAY_CAPACITY`: Maximum transaction capacity.
  - `ROUTER_CAPACITY`: Capacity for intermediate routers.
  - `LOG_NORMAL_MEAN` and `LOG_NORMAL_SCALE`: Parameters for a log-normal distribution, likely modeling transaction sizes or rates.

---

### **5. OMNeT-Specific Configurations**

```python
MAX_K = 4
NUM_LANDMARKS = MAX_K
```

- **OMNeT++ Parameters:**
  - `MAX_K`: Limits the number of paths or routes considered.
  - `NUM_LANDMARKS`: Specifies the number of key nodes (landmarks) for routing.

---

### **6. Recognized Signals for Analysis**

```python
RECOGNIZED_OMNET_SIGNALS = ["numInQueuePerChannel", "numSentPerChannel", "balancePerChannel", ...]
```

- **Signal List:** Specifies data points captured during simulations, such as:
  - Queue sizes (`numInQueuePerChannel`).
  - Sent transactions (`numSentPerChannel`).
  - Balance states (`balancePerChannel`).

---

### **7. Mapping Signals to Plots**

```python
INTERESTING_SIGNALS = dict()
INTERESTING_SIGNALS["completion_rate_cdfs"] = ["rateCompletedPerDest", "rateArrivedPerDest"]
...
```

- **Signal Mapping:** Links signals to specific plots for analysis:
  - `completion_rate_cdfs`: For cumulative distribution functions of completion rates.
  - `rateCompleted`, `numCompleted`, etc., track transaction rates, counts, and successes.

---

### **8. Per-Destination and Per-Channel Signals**

```python
per_dest_list = []
for signal in ["numWaiting", "probability", "bottleneck", ...]:
    INTERESTING_SIGNALS[signal] = signal + "PerDest"
    per_dest_list.append(signal + "PerDest")
...
```

- **Per-Destination Signals:** Analyzes signals at the level of individual destinations.
- **Per-Channel Signals:** Includes data like balances and queue sizes for specific channels.

---

### **9. ggplot Configuration**

```python
PLOT_DIR = "data/"
GGPLOT_DATA_DIR = "ggplot_data/"
SUMMARY_DIR = "figures/"
RESULT_DIR = HOME + "/" + OMNET + "/samples/spider_omnet/benchmarks/circulations/results/"
```

- **Plot Directories:** Organizes directories for storing data and visualizations.

---

### **10. Plot Scheme and Percent Mappings**

```python
SCHEME_CODE = { "priceSchemeWindow": "PS", "lndBaseline": "LND", ... }
PERCENT_MAPPING = { '0': 0, '20': 5, '45': 20, '65': 40 }
```

- **`SCHEME_CODE`:** Shorthand codes for routing schemes.
- **`PERCENT_MAPPING`:** Maps simulation parameters to percentages for plotting.

### **Purpose of the Script**

This script configures a large-scale simulation of a Payment Channel Network (PCN) or similar distributed system, using tools like OMNeT++ for simulations and ggplot for visualization. It integrates data collection, signal parsing, and visualization to evaluate network performance under various scenarios.
